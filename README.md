# Data Science Toolbox 3: Decision Trees and Unbalanced Data Sets
This is the implementation and code for our project "Decision Trees and Unbalanced Data Sets". The project brief was to identify malicous network activity in the KDD-99 intrusion detection data set. Our project focused on the unbalanced nature of the dataset. We considered how the inbalance affects the performance of decision trees and random forests, as well as how to overcome these problems. Within this we investigated the use of decision trees as meta-models, embedding specialised classifiers within them.

Our write-up providing a motivation, explanation of the code, and what we learnt, can be found [here](https://daniel.wilshirejones.com/res/data-science-3-kdd-99-report.pdf).

## R Setup
R dependencies can be installed by running the `install.R` file in this repositories root directory.
